# Welcome to [Online Radio Scraper Script](https://github.com/bymohamed/OnlineRadioScraper)!

I used this script to create a sqlite3 database containing streaming links to some radio channels. I scraped an online website to get this links using bs4. <br />
I used this list to make an android radio streaming app that I'll be sharing with you soon (check my [github](https://github.com/bymohamed/OnlineRadioScraper)).




## How to excute the script

As much as I remember I excute the code following this order :

    python scrapper.py
    python scrapping_links.py
    python scrapping_radios.py

Database I got in output. <br />

Tested before under windows and python3.
Feel free to use the code and enjoy!
